# Emul99

Emul99 is an emulator of the TI 99/4A home computer for Linux/MacOS
that gives special focus on TI's UCSD P-code
system.  It provides the following features:

- Emulation of console with 32K extension/SAMS with 16 MByte
- P-code card with optional 80 column/internal VDP dual screen
- Transfer tool for text files between host system and UCSD disk images
- Hotkeys to change speed of simulated system (for compiling large programs)
- Several disk systems:
  * DS/SD floppy controller with original DSR ROM using 90/180 KByte sector images
  * Program/data files in TIFILES/plain text format in host system directory
  * DSR for P-code system with disk images of up to 16 MByte
- TiPi access via its WebSocket interface
- Emulation of RS232 card
- External simulation of keystrokes via FIFO
- Cassette input/output using WAV files


## Compiling Emul99

Only the source code of the emulator is available; there is no binary
distribution. Requirements for installation are:

- Free Pascal Compiler (version 3.2.2 recommended)
- GTK3 and SDL2
- Original ROMs of the TI99 (not provided)

The required build environment can be installed as follows:

- Debian/Raspberry Pi OS/Chromebook

    sudo apt-get install fpc libgtk-3-dev libsdl2-dev

- Ubuntu/Linux Mint

    sudo apt install fp-compiler libsdl2-dev libgtk-3-dev build-essential

- MacOS

    brew install fpc sdl2 gtk+3

  The path to the installation directory (BREW_BASE) needs to be set to the
  base directory of Homebrew in the build script "compile-fpc.sh".

Two branches of the emulator are present at Github: the "main" branch
contains a reasonable stable version while the latest changes are in the
"develop" branch. To start, checkout the "main" branch with

    git clone https://www.github.com/statpascal/emul99

If you want to change to the develpment branch, the command 

    git checkout develop

can be used. The checkout creates the following directory structure in
the working directory (which is subsequently used by the example)
    .
    └── emul99
        ├── bin			Binaries and config files
        ├── diskfiles		Disk files (TIFILES format)
        ├── diskimages		Disk images (sector dumps)
        ├── modules		ROMs/GROMs of cartridges
        ├── roms		Console, P-code and DSR ROMs/GROMs
        ├── scripts		Helper scripts
        └── src			Pascal source code
            └── fpcunits

Change to the "emul99" directory and execute the build script
"compile-fpc.sh" which generates the binaries "emul99" (the emulator) and
"ucsddskman" (a disk image manager for UCSD text files) in the "bin"
directory.  As an alternative, a Lazarus project file is provided in the
"src" directory.

The assembly of the DSR ROMs for the simulated devices and the dummy ROM at
the end of the build script is optional; these binaries are included in the
distribution.

Changing to the "bin" directory and executing "emul99" starts the emulator
with a simple dummy ROM image displaying a message. At this point, the 
emulator is running - but to do anything useful the original ROMs (see
section ROM files below) need to be copied to the "roms" directory.


## Configuration

The emulator is configured using text files which can be loaded by giving
them as command line arguments; e.g.  "./emul99 exbasic.cfg".  These config
files load cartridges, activate optional hardware and configure file
names/directories for disk images.

If no config file is given as argument, the default file "ti99.cfg" is used. 
Configuration files for some cartridges and the UCSD system are povided as
examples in the "bin" directory.  All options are shown and described in
"example.cfg".

Options may also be specified on the command line, overriding
previous values (except P-code GROM files). E.g., to apply the "Disk Manager" to a
a disk different from the one given in the config file the command

    bin/emul99 bin/diskman.cfg fdc_dsk1=diskimages/disk1.dsk

may be used.

Pathes given in config file are relative to the location of the config file while pathes
provided on the command line are relative to the current working directory.

It is not possible to change any part of the configuration (e.g., disk
images or cartridges) while the emulator is running. This can be mitigated
by running multiple instances with different configurations simultaneously
on the same disk images (see below).


## ROM files

The original ROMs are copyrighted and cannot be distributed with the
emulator.  The directory "roms" contains a file "roms.txt" showing the file
names, sizes and MD5 hashes as they are expected by the various
configuration files (the names follow 

For a working setup, at least the console ROM and GROMs (combined
into a single file and padded to 8 KB) are required.  All config files in
the bin directory include "common.cfg" which loads these ROMS.

    cpu_freq = 3000000
    console_rom = ../roms/994aROM.Bin
    console_groms = ../roms/994AGROM.Bin

Additional ROMs that can be utilized are 

- the original disk controller DSR,
- the DSR of the TiPi (included in the package), 
- the DSR of the RS232 card,
- the ROMs/GROMs of the P-code card.  

Multiple GROM bases within the console are not supported. Cartridge ROMs
can be bank switched and inverted (option "cart_inverted"). 
For a bank switched ROM, either multiple
8 KB files (e.g., the card_rom entries in exbasic.cfg) or a single large
file may be specified.

For example, to load a typical cartridge consisting of a ROM and GROM image,
one would specify

    cart_rom = ../modules/ParsecC.Bin
    cart_groms = ../modules/ParsecG.Bin

For a bank switched cartridge with multiple 8 KB ROM files, this becomes

    cart_rom = ../modules/TI-ExtBC.Bin
    cart_rom = ../modules/TI-ExtBD.Bin
    cart_groms = ../modules/TI-ExtBG.Bin

A large bank switched ROM (like the 512 KB file of the MegaDemo) requires
just

    cart_rom = ../modules/megademo.bin


## System Memory

Without further options, only the console with 16 KByte VDP RAM and the 256
byte scratch pad is simulated. The option "mem_ext" activates either a
standard 32 KByte extension with 

    mem_ext = 2

or a 16 MByte SAMS extension with 

    mem_ext = 1

The older key "mem_32k_ext" can also be used for compatibility with previous
versions of the emulator.

When loading the MiniMemory module, its 4 KByte RAM needs to be activated
seperately with "cart_minimem":

    cart_rom = ../modules/MiniMemC.Bin
    cart_groms = ../modules/MiniMemG.Bin
    cart_minimem = 1

The contents of the MiniMemory RAM are not preserved between different runs
of the emulator.


## Keyboard

Keys are mapped to a standard keyboard.  

- FCTN: ALT-Left (Linux), CMD-Right (Mac)
- Quit: ALT-Left + = (Linux), CMD-Right + = (Mac)
- Alpha Lock: permanently switched off
- First Joystick: 4, 6, 8, 2 in numeric pad, fire button is 0

A line feed in the Terminal Emulator II module is generated with Ctrl+J.
These mappings are defined in
the file "ti99.pas" and can only be modified by editing the source file.

Five function keys are used to change the execution speed of the simulated
system:

| Key | Function |
|-----|----------|
| F4  | set frequency to 3 MHz |
| F5  | restore CPU frequency to value in configuration file (default 3 MHz) |
| F6  | set frequency to 1 GHz (resulting in maximum speed as current systems will not be able to actually achieve this) |
| F7  | decrease CPU frequency by 1 MHz |
| F8  | increase CPU frequency by 1 MHz |

A reset key can be configured using the "reset_key" option; it defaults to
the Pause/Break key. The "magic numbers" are the key codes of GTK3; a rather
incomplete list is e.g. in the source file src/fpcunits/gtk3.pas.

    reset_key = 65299

Key presses can be simulated by sending them to an optional named pipe that
is configured with

    key_input = name

Printable characters can be sent as is; in addition the emulator handles the
following codes:

| Dez | Hex | Function |
|---- |-----|----------|
|  10 | 0a  | return key |
| 128 | 80  | press/hold Shift key |
| 129 | 81  | release Shift key |
| 130 | 82  | press/hold Ctrl key |
| 131 | 83  | release Ctrl key |
| 132 | 84  | press/hold Fctn key |
| 133 | 85  | release Fctn key |
| 251 | fb  | read next byte into n and pause input for n/10 seconds
| 252 | fc  | restore default CPU frequency |
| 253 | fd  | set max CPU frequency |
| 254 | fe  | reset key |
| 255 | ff  | quit emulator |

The following example shows the feeding of a minimal program into XB,
waiting for 1 second in the main menu and for 3 seconds after starting
XB.

    echo -n 1$'\xfb\x0a'2>KEY_IN	# Wait 1s in menu screen
    echo -n $'\xfb\x1e'>KEY_IN	  	# Wait 3s for XB, no new line
    echo 10 PRINT \"HELLO WORLD\">KEY_IN
    echo 20 END>KEY_IN
    echo RUN>KEY_IN

A more realistic example in "scripts/juwel.sh" shows how the emulator can be
automated from Stefan Bauch's TiCodEd to compile, assemble and run a BASIC
program.

## Disk access

There are several ways to simulate disk access:

- The original DSR of the 90/180 KB TI disk controller
- Files in TIFILES format in a configurable directory of the host
- WebSocket interface of TiPi
- Special DSR for P-Code system (see next section)

### Disk controller DSR

The first option requires the original ROM of the disk controller; using the
config entries "fdc_dsr" and "fdc_dsk1" to "fdc_dsk3" up to three disk
images (92160 bytes for SS/SD, 184320 bytes for DS/SD) can be loaded.  It
provides DSK1 through DSK3 devices. The following example shows a typical
configuration.

    fdc_dsr = ../roms/Disk.Bin
    fdc_dsk1 = ../diskimages/test1.dsk
    fdc_dsk2 = ../diskimages/test2.dsk
    fdc_dsk3 = ../diskimages/test3.dsk

### Files on host system

To store files in a host system directory, the config entries "disksim_dsr"
and "disksim_dir" need to be specified.  The DSR in "roms/disksim.bin"
provides DSK0 through DSK3.  

    disksim_dsr    = ../roms/disksim.bin
    disksim_dir    = ../diskfiles
    ; disksim_text = 1

The host system DSR can be used together with the disk controller DSR: the
latter one uses a lower CRU base resulting in only DSK0 pointing to the host
directory (see e.g. the example config file bin/exbasic.cfg). File names
containing slashes are modified to avoid directory traversal on the host.

Note that the host system DSR does not provide sector based access to the disk or
individual files (only PAB based operations are supported); in particular it
is not possible to get a directory listing.

Files are usually stored in TIFILES format, with several exceptions upon
reading:

- Files used with load (PAB operation 5, OLD command in Basic) may omit the
  TIFILES header
- Plain text files can be loaded in DIS/VAR format; lines are truncated to
  the length specified in the PAB.

When saving DIS/VAR files, it is possible to omit the TIFILES header and
write plain text files.

- For single files by specifying the ?W. name prefix, e.g. using
  DSK0.?W.FILENAME
- For all files with the configuration option disksim_text=1

With this option, it is not possible to append to an existing file.

The emulator puts an exclusive advisory lock on the files it writes. Other
programs needing to synchronize with its output can wait on this lock to
ensure that a file has been closed. For example, while executing the following program

    10 OPEN #1:"DSK0.?W.LOCKTEST", DISPLAY, VARIABLE 80, OUTPUT
    20 FOR I=1 TO 500
    30 PRINT #1:"This is line";I
    40 NEXT I
    50 CLOSE #1

it is possible to wait for the file being closed  with the shell command

    flock LOCKTEST echo "Got the lock"

Opening and locking a file is not an atomic operation, so it is best to
wait until some data has been written.

### TiPi

The TiPi hardware is simulated and can be used with the original DSR ROM (an
assembled version is included in the "roms" directory).  On the Raspberry Pi
side, WebSocket emulation mode needs to be enabled; the file README.md in
the emulation directory of the tipi installation provides further details. 
IP and port of the WebSocket server are set in a config file as shown; see
example.cfg or tipi.cfg for a complete example.

    tipi_dsr = ../roms/tipi.bin
    tipi_addr = 127.0.0.1:9901

The code does almost no error checking; if the connection to the WebSocket
server cannot be established or gets broken the emulated system will either
freeze or perform a reset.  Mouse simulation is not yet tested and will
probably not work.


## P-code simulation

### Disk access in P-code

The P-code system uses only sector based disk operations (subroutine >10 of
the DSR) which can address a maximum of 65536 disk sectors with 256 bytes
each. Correspondingly, the P-code system can utilize 32768 blocks with 512
bytes. The pcodedisk DSR (file roms/pcodedisk.bin) makes use of these limits 
to provide disk images of up to 16 MByte and can be used as an alternative
to the original floppy DSR which limits disks to 90/180 KB. However, as it only
supports subroutine >10, it is not useful outside the P-code environment. It is configured
with the following settings:

    pcodedisk_dsr = ../roms/pcodedisk.bin
    pcodedisk_dsk1 = ../diskimages/ucsd_system_1.dsk
    pcodedisk_dsk2 = ../diskimages/ucsd_dev_1.dsk
    pcodedisk_dsk3 = ../diskimages/ucsd_test.dsk

The images files can be created with dd; e.g. use 

    dd if=/dev/zero of=blank.disk bs=512 count=32768 

to create a disk image of maximal size. A UCSD file system can then be
added from within the P-code system with the "Zero" option of the Filer,
which will ask for the number of blocks on the disk (with 32767 being the
maximum).

A 360 KByte image can hold the complete UCSD system comprising four 90 KB
disks: one can copy all files with the Filer to a single 360 KB image and use it
as first disk.

With 90 KB or 180 KB disk images the original disk DSR may be used as
well:

    fdc_dsr = ../roms/Disk.Bin
    fdc_dsk1 = ../diskimages/ucsd_pascal_compiler.dsk
    fdc_dsk2 = ../diskimages/ucsd_pascal_editor_filer_1.dsk
    fdc_dsk3 = ../diskimages/ucsd_pascal_editor_filer_2.dsk

### Screen options

An internal 80x24 screen image is maintained at memory address 2000h.  The
emulator provides a flag "pcode_screen80" to use this image instead of or
in addition to the output created by the VDP (see ucsd-80.cfg) to display 80
columns of text:

    pcode_screen80 = 1

    ; for dual screen display, use 
    ; pcode_screen80 = 2

With SAMS support enabled, it is assumed that the mapping of the 3rd memory
page (which contains the screen buffer) uses the default value of the
transparent mode. It is safe to temporarily use the page for other
purposes, but moving the screen buffer to another page will require
patches in the function getPcodeScreenBuffer in the emulator source.

### UCSD disk manager

A simple tool (ucsddiskman) can list the contents of a UCSD disk image and
copy text files between the host system and disk images. It provides the
following options:

    ucsddskman image-name list
    ucsddskman image-name extract ucsd-file local-file
    ucsddskman image-name add ucsd-file local-file
    ucsddskman image-name remove ucsd-file

Files are only added after the last used block. To update an existing text
file in a disk image, it first needs to be removed.

### Overclocking

Overclocking the system (cpu_freq setting in the configuration file) might
also be desirable.  The example configuration in ucsd-80.cfg uses a fivefold
speed (15 MHz) which is close to making the keyboard unusable.  Using the
hotkeys F4 through F8 (see above), the CPU frequence can be changed
temporarily.


## Multiple Instances

Disk images (using the original DSR or the P-code DSR) are memory mapped and
can be shared between multiple instances of the emulator. Changes are
immediately visible to other instances but there is no mechanism to
synchronize them; so data corruption is possible if they are written to at
the same time.

The emulator does not provide a utility to transfer files between standard
TI disk images and the host system. Programs like xdm99 from Ralph Benzinger's
xdt99 tools can be utilized for this task.


## Cassette I/O

The emulator can read and write WAV files (22050 Hz, unsigned 8 bit, mono)
that can be played to or read from a real machine. Because there is no
mechanism to set the position of the tape in the user interface, two
different WAV files are used for input and output (see e.g. exbasic.cfg). 
The input wave file is loaded and analyzed when the emulator starts, so
later changes do not have any effect on a running session. The required
config settings are:

    cass_out = ../diskimages/cass-out.wav
    cass_in = ../diskimages/cass-in.wav

One can store multiple programs and/or data files in an output WAV
file; they have to be loaded again in the same order.

There is no attempt to reconstruct bad recordings from old cassette tapes -
the emulator will consider any input exceeding the ReadThreshold (see
tape.pas) as a toggle of the cassette input.


## Serial/Parallel I/O

Serial emulation requires the original DSR ROM of the RS232C card. Input and
output is redirected to the file system with configurable file names or
named pipes. A named pipe should be used for input data. 

The current implementation only provides the functionality
used by TI's DSR. Interrupt handling is supported for incoming data as
required by the Terminal Emulator module.

A typical configuration (suited for the P-Code system) is shown in bin/serial.cfg:

    rs232_dsr = ../roms/RS232.Bin

    RS232/1_out = ../REMOUT,nozero
    RS232/2_out = ../PRINTER,nozero,append
    PIO/1_out = ../PIOOUT

    ; A FIFO (named pipe) should be used for input

    RS232/1_in = ../REMIN
    PIO/1_in = ../PIOIN

File names are relative to the configuration directory (bin). 
Two options can be added to output filenames:

- nozero: will not output any zero bytes. This is useful when transferring text files with the Transfer option of the Filer, which simply copies complete disk blocks including zeroes.
- append: appends to an existing file instead of overwriting it.

Files (or FIFOs for input files) will be created if they do not exist.
In UCSD-Pascal, the REMIN FIFO can be read  with the following program:

    program serread;
    var
        f: text;
        ch: char;
    begin
        reset (f, 'REMIN:');
        while not eof (f) do
            begin
                read (f, ch);
                if ch = chr (10) then
                    writeln
                else
                    write (ch)
            end;
        close (f)
    end.

Upon execution, the program will read from the FIFO until an EOF is
signalled with a binary value of 3. E.g. the following Linux commands feed
two lines into the program, followed by EOF:

    echo "This is the first line" > REMIN
    echo "This is the second line" > REMIN
    echo -n $'\x03' > REMIN

In Extended BASIC, the following program is equivalent to the above Pascal
program:

    100 OPEN #1:"RS232/1.EC",INPUT ,DISPLAY ,FIXED 1
    110 LINPUT #1:A$
    120 IF A$=CHR$(10)THEN PRINT ELSE PRINT A$;
    130 IF A$<>CHR$(3)THEN 110
    140 CLOSE #1

It can be sent to the file PRINTER with

    LIST "RS232/2"


## Implementation Notes

The implementation is rather concise (about 5900 lines of Pascal source code
without the UCSD disk manager).  A complete build of the emulator takes less
than a second on a decent system, so it is easy to add debug output.  E.g. 
a complete instruction trace can be activated by uncommenting a single line
in "procedure executeInstruction" in file tms9900.pas

CPU, VDP and the 9901 timer are interleaved and executed in a seperate
thread; this thread will perform a sleep every millisecond to synchronize
with real time. 

The DSRs for the simulated devices (host directory and P-Code disk system)
as well as the keyboard hook for simulated input transform control to the
emulator with an "XOP 0" instruction, specifying the requested operation as
a dummy source address.  The simulated TMS9900 dispatches these XOP calls in
the file "xophandler.pas"

The emulator is developed and tested using the following environments:

- openSuse Tumbleweed (x64): main development system
- Raspberry Pi OS (Debian bookworm) on Pi 4
- Linux environment of ARM Chromebook (Debian bookworm)
- MacOS 14 Sonoma (x64)

## Known Bugs and Limitations

- The unofficial video modes of the VDP might work but remain untested 
  as no software seems to use them.
- The directory based disk DSR does not provide sector based
  access and cannot read directory information. Software requiring this may
  use the original disk controller DSR.
- TI's GROM address counter jumps to the beginning of the respective GROM when
  6K is reached. This behaviour is implemented in "grom.pas" but may be
  incompatible with larger 3rd party GROMs.
- Comparing the performance of a BASIC program with that of a real machine, 
  the emulator is about 5% too fast. 
- The sound generator is sampled about 870 times per second and it is
  assumed that its settings remain unchanged during the sampling interval.
  Changes occuring during that interval should be recorded with a CPU
  timestamp and handled when generating output.
- An infinite recursion of "X" operations crashes the emulator with a stack
  overflow.
- The emulation of the RS232 card provides only the functionality used by TI's DSR.

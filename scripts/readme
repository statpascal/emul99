The "scripts" directory contains the following:

- juwel7.sh

A Bash script (Linux) to start Extented Basic or the Juwel7 Basic Compiler
as post processing command in Stefan Bauch's TiCodEd.  The complete
compilation process is automated and leads to a running program in about 10
seconds.  For the selection menu of the Juwel7 package to work properly, the
following line must be added to the LOAD program (pre-selecting the Compiler
option):

98 CALL PEEK(-7,R):: IF R<3 THEN CALL LOAD(-7,3)

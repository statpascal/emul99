Reading from FIFO using REMIN:

After creating a FIFO in the Linux file system with

mkfifo /tmp/rs232_1_in.dat

it can be connected to the REMIN: device of the UCSD P-Code system
with a configuration file containing the lines:

serial_dsr = ../roms/serial.bin

RS232/1_out = /tmp/rs232_1_out.dat
RS232/2_out = /tmp/rs232_2_out.dat

RS232/1_in = /tmp/rs232_1_in.dat

Note that REMIN: is connected to the first, PRINTER: to the second serial
port. The following example shows a simple program reading a text from the
REMIN: device.

program serread;
var
    f: text;
    ch: char;
begin
    reset (f, 'REMIN:');
    while not eof (f) do
        begin
            read (f, ch);
            if ch = chr (10) then
                writeln
            else
                write (ch)
        end;
    close (f)
end.

Upon execution, the program will read from the FIFO until an EOF is
signalled with a binary value of 3. E.g. the following Linux commands feed
two lines into the program, followed by EOF:

echo "This is the first line" > /tmp/rs232_1_in.dat
echo "This is the second line" > /tmp/rs232_1_in.dat
echo -n $'\x03' > /tmp/rs232_1_in.dat

Reading a file in this manner does not yet work with the Transfer menu
option of the UCSD Filer.
